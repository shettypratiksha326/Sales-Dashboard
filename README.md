# Sales-Dashboard
Created an interactive Sales Dashboard for a Restaurant in Power BI, showcasing key metrics such as total sales, average order value, and sales by category. The dashboard includes monthly trend analysis using line charts, sales distribution by menu item with bar charts, and a breakdown of sales by time of day using heat maps. Additionally, it features a funnel chart for customer conversion rates and a geographic map showing sales by location. This tool provides real-time insights into restaurant performance, helping optimize operations, marketing, and menu offerings.
